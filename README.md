Reload Dat Frame
===

A super small Firefox add-on for reloading a frame from the right click context menu.

I know, I know. Firefox already lets you reload a specific frame natively. And you're correct, it does. However, it's buried in a sub-menu and listed with a bunch of other items and visually look the same. It makes it very difficult to quickly navigate to and select when on a coding rampage.

If you work in a system that happens to use HTML frames and love Mozilla Firefox, this add-on should save you second(s) each time you use it and those seconds will add up to saving a lot of time.
